# opus1_Horiseon_Refactor

## Description 

This project is a refactor of an existing webpage to do the following:
    1. Change the codebase so that it follows accessibility standards.
    2. Make any changes to the codebase to clean it up from what was there previously.

To do so, the source code needed semantic elements added. These elements needed to follow a logical structure. 

The images needed alt attributes, and the headings needed to be in sequential order.
